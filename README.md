Vision Guided Grasping

Computer vision is often required to provide data for the grasping of a target. Here, I present an integrated vision-guided grasping system for service robots. My system integrates computer vision to capture the shape of an object, position and depth of the image from the RGB-D sensor. I've implemented my planner on a real manipulator and was able to grasp the object through the data received by the computer vision technique.
